This is a 3D platformer made in Unity as part of my Game Development course at Image Campus.
Inspired by Crash Bandicoot, it features classic platforming levels and ends with a fast-paced runner-style finale.

On the technical side, the game was built following fundamental design patterns such as S.O.L.I.D. and FSM (Finite State Machine), resulting in stable performance, no major bugs, and clean, scalable code that's ready for more levels or new mechanics with no fuss.

Gameplay-wise, the game includes different camera typesâ€”classic third-person, camera locks, cinematic transitions, and even a special runner camera for the final level.
The player can perform a basic jump, as well as roll and combine roll + jump for more advanced movement.

The game supports both mouse & keyboard and gamepad input:

Keyboard + Mouse: Move with WASD + mouse, jump with Space, roll with Shift

Gamepad: Move with both sticks, jump with X, roll with O

Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making (and debugging) it!
